                <h1>Plot</h1>
                <P>The Mortal Instruments is a series of six young adult fantasy novels written by American author Cassandra Clare, the last of 
                    which was published on May 27, 2014. The Mortal Instruments is chronologically the third series of a planned five in The 
                    Shadowhunter Chronicles but was the first one published. It follows Clarissa Fray, who interacts with a group of Nephilim known 
                    as Shadowhunters while also discovering her own heritage and her family history. The Shadowhunters protect the world of 
                    mundane/human people, who are also called mundanes or "mundies", from dark forces beyond their world. The book series falls 
                    under the young adult genre, specifically that of the paranormal romance/urban fantasy and supernatural genres.</P><br>
                <P>New York City teenager Clary Fray begins seeing and drawing a strange symbol, worrying her mother Jocelyn Fray and family 
                    friend, Luke Garroway. At a crowded nightclub with friend, Simon Lewis, only Clary can see Jace Wayland and his accomplices 
                    killing a man. The next day, two men, Emil Pangborn and Samuel Blackwell, arrive at the Fray apartment searching for a cup. 
                    Jocelyn calls Clary, frantically telling her to stay away and to warn Luke about someone named Valentine; she then drinks a 
                    potion putting her in a deep sleep. Returning home, Clary finds her mother missing and is attacked by a dog-like creature. 
                    Jace, a "Shadowhunter", appears and kills it, explaining that it, like the "man" killed at the nightclub, was a demon in 
                    another form.</P>
